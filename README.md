# Mastermind_Terminal_Game
A simple python game which replicates the well-known board game, Mastermind. This game has many similarities to the more popular online game "Wordle" but instead of using letters in words, Mastermind uses colours and doesn't check for correct positions. This is just a mini side-project to motivate me, whilst I work on a larger project.
